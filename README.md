# kalshi_temp_watcher

Kalshi, a predictive market, has a challenge to forecast the daily high temperature in New York City and Chicago for a given day. I am in the proccess of building out a data set using API's and web scraping techniques that monitor hourly temperature in those cities. The goal would be to compile several months worth of data and begin an exploratory data analysis to derive insight to make more accurate predictions for the daily high temp challenge
